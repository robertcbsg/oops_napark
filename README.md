### Configuring the Parking Lot

For admin actions, such as adding entry points and setting up the parking lot map, we can access the API.
1. **Entry Points**. To setup the Parking Lot, let's add the entry points first.

#### POST | `/api/v1/parking/entry_points`
```json
{
    "entry_points": [
        {
           "name": "Seventh exit"
        },
        {
           "name": "8th park ave."
        }
    ]
}
```

2. **Parking Slots**. Then we can add the Parking Slots with the corresponding distance array.

#### POST | `/api/v1/parking/slots`
```json
{
    "size": "SP",
    "distance_from_entries": [
        {
            "name": "north exit",
            "distance": 1
        },
        {
            "name": "west exit",
            "distance": 4
        },
        {
            "name": "Southwest exit",
            "distance": 2
        }
    ]
}
```

3. **Clock**. For demo purposes, instead of using the system's time we have the 'Clock' table. This way we can 'move' time by simply calling the clock API.

#### POST | `/api/v1/clock`
```json
{
    "hours": 0,
    "minutes": 1
}
```
